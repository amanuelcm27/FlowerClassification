# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification

A classical machine learning project using the Iris dataset to classify flowers based on sepal and petal dimensions. Multiple algorithms were tested and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.

## 📌 Objective

Build a machine learning classifier that can predict the species of an Iris flower using simple features. This project serves as a foundational exercise in classification and model comparison.

## ✅ Highlights
- Used **Logistic Regression**, **KNN**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**.
- Visualized feature distributions and correlations.
- Achieved **97% accuracy** with Random Forest on the test set.
- Included a comparison matrix of all models.

## 🧪 Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- seaborn & matplotlib

## 📊 Results
| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 95%     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 96%     |
| Decision Tree       | 94%     |
| Random Forest       | **97%** |
